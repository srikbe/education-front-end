DATA INFO
ANTHEA
Child care: Bar chart showing cost of childcare for children 0-5 vin a center to the cost of public college (state college) tuition by state

JAMES
State average test scores in 15 states
Per-pupil spending by state; there are breakdowns by poverty between districts

CHIBUZO
2010 School Improvement Grant information. Originally wanted to create a chart that reflected grant award $ or types of transformation models, but missing information for some key states (e.g., TX).
