Data
For Childcare data
I started at ChildcareAware.org - http://www.usa.childcareaware.org/advocacy-public-policy/resources/reports-and-research/costofcare/
I downloaded their report on Parents and the High Cost of Childcare. 
I used tabula to convert the data from pdf into csv. I then used an online tool (http://state.1keydata.com/state-abbreviations.php) to add the state abbreviation to the data. Finally, I used an online CSV to JSON tool (http://www.csvjson.com/csv2json) to convert my data to JSON format.
