  <h2>2010 School Improvement Grant Recipients </h2>
 <p> In 2010, the United States Congress approved nearly $3.5 billion to be disbursed to state governments to improve chronically underperforming schools through the School Improvement Grant (SIG). <br>
 Grant funds for each school were contingent on an agreement by the local education agency to implement a designated school "turnaround" model. <br> 
 The following chart depicts the number of the schools in each state that were awarded SIG funds and organizes this information by geographical region (North, South, Midwest, and West). <br>
