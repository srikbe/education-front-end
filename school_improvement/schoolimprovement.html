  <center><h2>2010 School Improvement Grant Recipients </h2>
 <p> In 2010, the United States Congress approved nearly $3.5 billion to be disbursed to state governments to improve chronically underperforming schools through the School Improvement Grant (SIG). Grant funds for each school were contingent on an agreement by the local education agency to implement a designated school "turnaround" model.  In the chart below, we see the number of the schools in each state that were awarded SIG funds with each geographic region (North, South, Midwest, and West) in a different color. The southern states receive the most money for SIG's, followed by the western states, primarily California.</center>
