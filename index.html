<center><h2>High School Graduation Rates by County</h2>
 <p/>High school graduation rates  in the U.S. vary significantly from region to region.  In the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, dropout rates are relatively low.  In the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains regions, dropout rates are high, but many of these high dropout rates are in counties with extremely low populations.  Across the south, however, even in states with large population, such as Florida and Texas, the high school dropout rate is higher than average.</p>
