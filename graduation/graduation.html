  <p/>The dropout rate from high school varies significantly from region to region.  In the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, dropout rates are relatively low.  In the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains regions, dropout rates are high, but many of these high dropout rates are in counties with extremely low populations.  Across the south, however, even in states with large population, such as Florida and Texas, there are very high rates of high school dropouts.</p>
